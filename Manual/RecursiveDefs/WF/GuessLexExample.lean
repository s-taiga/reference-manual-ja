If there is no {keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.declaration}`termination_by` clause, Lean attempts to infer a measure for well-founded recursion.
If it fails, then it prints the table mentioned above.
In this example, the {keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.declaration}`decreasing_by` clause simply prevents Lean from also attempting structural recursion; this keeps the error message specific.

```lean (error := true) (keep := false) (name := badwf)
def f : (n m l : Nat) → Nat
  | n+1, m+1, l+1 => [
      f (n+1) (m+1) (l+1),
      f (n+1) (m-1) (l),
      f (n)   (m+1) (l) ].sum
  | _, _, _ => 0
decreasing_by all_goals decreasing_tactic
```
```leanOutput badwf (whitespace := lax)
Could not find a decreasing measure.
The arguments relate at each recursive call as follows:
(<, ≤, =: relation proved, ? all proofs failed, _: no proof attempted)
           n m l
1) 30:6-25 = = =
2) 31:6-23 = < _
3) 32:6-23 < _ _
Please use `termination_by` to specify a decreasing measure.
```

:::comment
The three recursive calls are identified by their source positions.
This message conveys the following facts:

:::



:::comment
* In the first recursive call, all arguments are (provably) equal to the parameters
* In the second recursive call, the first argument is equal to the first parameter and the second argument is provably smaller than the second parameter.
  The third parameter was not checked for this recursive call, because it was not necessary to determine that no suitable termination argument exists.
* In the third recursive call, the first argument decreases strictly, and the other arguments were not checked.

:::comment
When termination proofs fail in this manner, a good technique to discover the problem is to explicitly indicate the expected termination argument using {keywordOf Lean.Parser.Command.declaration}`termination_by`.
This will surface the messages from the failing tactic.
