:::example "Course-of-Values Tables"
This definition is equivalent to {name}`List.below`:
```lean
def List.below' {α : Type u} {motive : List α → Sort u} : List α → Sort (max 1 u)
  | [] => PUnit
  | _ :: xs => motive xs ×' xs.below' (motive := motive)
```

```lean (show := false)
theorem List.below_eq_below' : @List.below = @List.below' := by
  funext α motive xs
  induction xs <;> simp [List.below, below']
  congr
```

In other words, for a given {tech}[motive], {lean}`List.below'` is a type that contains a realization of the motive for all suffixes of the list.

More recursive arguments require further nested iterations of the product type.
For instance, binary trees have two recursive occurrences.
```lean
inductive Tree (α : Type u) : Type u where
  | leaf
  | branch (left : Tree α) (val : α) (right : Tree α)
```

It's corresponding course-of-values table contains the realizations of the motive for all subtrees:
```lean
def Tree.below' {α : Type u} {motive : Tree α → Sort u} : Tree α → Sort (max 1 u)
  | .leaf => PUnit
  | .branch left _val right =>
    motive left ×' motive right ×'
    left.below' (motive := motive) ×'
    right.below' (motive := motive)
```

```lean (show := false)
theorem Tree.below_eq_below' : @Tree.below = @Tree.below' := by
  funext α motive t
  induction t <;> simp [Tree.below, below']
  congr
```

For both lists and trees, the `brecOn` operator expects just a single case, rather than one per constructor.
This case accepts a list or tree along with a table of results for all smaller values; from this, it should satisfy the motive for the provided value.
Dependent case analysis of the provided value automatically refines the type of the memo table, providing everything needed.

The following definitions are equivalent to {name}`List.brecOn` and {name}`Tree.brecOn`, respectively.
The primitive recursive helpers {name}`List.brecOnTable`  and {name}`Tree.brecOnTable` compute the course-of-values tables along with the final results, and the actual definitions of the `brecOn` operators simply project out the result.
```lean
def List.brecOnTable {α : Type u}
    {motive : List α → Sort u}
    (xs : List α)
    (step :
      (ys : List α) →
      ys.below' (motive := motive) →
      motive ys) :
    motive xs ×' xs.below' (motive := motive) :=
  match xs with
  | [] => ⟨step [] PUnit.unit, PUnit.unit⟩
  | x :: xs =>
    let res := xs.brecOnTable (motive := motive) step
    let val := step (x :: xs) res
    ⟨val, res⟩
```

```lean
def Tree.brecOnTable {α : Type u}
    {motive : Tree α → Sort u}
    (t : Tree α)
    (step :
      (ys : Tree α) →
      ys.below' (motive := motive) →
      motive ys) :
    motive t ×' t.below' (motive := motive) :=
  match t with
  | .leaf => ⟨step .leaf PUnit.unit, PUnit.unit⟩
  | .branch left val right =>
    let resLeft := left.brecOnTable (motive := motive) step
    let resRight := right.brecOnTable (motive := motive) step
    let branchRes := ⟨resLeft.1, resRight.1, resLeft.2, resRight.2⟩
    let val := step (.branch left val right) branchRes
    ⟨val, branchRes⟩
```

```lean
def List.brecOn' {α : Type u}
    {motive : List α → Sort u}
    (xs : List α)
    (step :
      (ys : List α) →
      ys.below' (motive := motive) →
      motive ys) :
    motive xs :=
  (xs.brecOnTable (motive := motive) step).1
```

```lean
def Tree.brecOn' {α : Type u}
    {motive : Tree α → Sort u}
    (t : Tree α)
    (step :
      (ys : Tree α) →
      ys.below' (motive := motive) →
      motive ys) :
    motive t :=
  (t.brecOnTable (motive := motive) step).1
```

-- Proving the above-claimed equivalence is too time consuming, but evaluating a few examples will at least catch silly mistakes!
