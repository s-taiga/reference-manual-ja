#doc (Manual) "Combined Error and State Monads" =>

```lean (show := false)
variable (ε : Type u) (σ σ' : Type u) (α : Type u)
```

The {name}`EStateM` monad has both exceptions and mutable state.
{lean}`EStateM ε σ α` is logically equivalent to {lean}`ExceptT ε (StateM σ) α`.
While {lean}`ExceptT ε (StateM σ)` evaluates to the type {lean}`σ → Except ε α × σ`, the type {lean}`EStateM ε σ α` evaluates to {lean}`σ → EStateM.Result ε σ α`.
{name}`EStateM.Result` is an inductive type that's very similar to {name}`Except`, except both constructors have an additional field for the state.
In compiled code, this representation removes one level of indirection from each monadic bind.

```lean (show := false)
/-- info: σ → Except ε α × σ -/
#guard_msgs in
#reduce (types := true) ExceptT ε (StateM σ) α

/-- info: σ → EStateM.Result ε σ α -/
#guard_msgs in
#reduce (types := true) EStateM ε σ α
```

# State Rollback

Composing {name}`StateT` and {name}`ExceptT` in different orders causes exceptions to interact differently with state.
In one ordering, state changes are rolled back when exceptions are caught; in the other, they persist.
The latter option matches the semantics of most imperative programming languages, but the former is very useful for search-based problems.
Often, some but not all state should be rolled back; this can be achieved by “sandwiching” {name}`ExceptT` between two separate uses of {name}`StateT`.

To avoid yet another layer of indirection via the use of {lean}`StateT σ (EStateM ε σ') α`, {name}`EStateM` offers the {name}`EStateM.Backtrackable` {tech}[型クラス]type class.
This class specifies some part of the state that can be saved and restored.
{name}`EStateM` then arranges for the saving and restoring to take place around error handling.

{docstring EStateM.Backtrackable}

There is a universally-applicable instance of {name EStateM.Backtrackable}`Backtrackable` that neither saves nor restores anything.
Because instance synthesis chooses the most recent instance first, the universal instance is used only if no other instance has been defined.

{docstring EStateM.nonBacktrackable}
